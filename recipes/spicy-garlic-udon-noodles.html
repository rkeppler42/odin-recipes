    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      These spicy garlic udon noodles are chewy and savory with a garlicky spicy
      sauce, and a winner for a quick weekday meal. If you want to jazz them up
      even more, serve topped with a fried egg or stir in some saut√©ed shrimp.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 garlic cloves, finely minced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons hoisin sauce</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons sesame oil</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Noodles</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 (8 ounce) blocks frozen udon noodles</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon sliced green onions</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare the sauce by combining garlic, soy sauce, hoisin, sesame oil,
        and red pepper flakes in a small bowl; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of water to a boil, and add udon blocks. Let them sit
        in the water until they start to unwind, 1 to 2 minutes. Noodles should
        remain a little chewy. Drain noodles, and return to the pot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add sauce, and stir until noodles are well coated. Move to a serving
        dish, garnish with sliced green onions and sesame seeds, and serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
